How do I network Sync Variables?

1. Set up the FSM like you normally would with all your logic and variables set up.
2. Any variables you want to 'Network Sync', be sure the 'Network Sync' box is checked.
	Additionally, 'Array', 'Enum', and 'Rect' can still be used, but you must preface the variable name
	with the world 'network'. 'String' and 'Array' variables also need their capacities to be in their name.
	_2, _4, _8, _16, _32, _64, _128, _256, and _512 can be used at the end of the name to set its capactiy.
	Its worth noting, GameObject variable types cannot be sync'd.
3. When you are ready to set up your FSM for network syncing, in the inspector, add the component called
	'Playmaker Fusion Setup Sync Variables'. 
4. You can technically setup multiple FSMs at the same time, but I would just take one, and put it in the
	'Fsms to Check' array in the insepctor (add an entry, drag and drop the FSM component into the new field you created).
5. Click the 'Step 1' button, and Wait for Unity to finish compiling (its going to create a new script in the background).
6. Once it seems unity is finished compiling, click 'Step 2'. The 'Playmaker Fusion Setup Sync Variables' component will 
	disappear to be replaced by the new network sync component.
7. If in prefab mode, if the only change you did was set up the sync, you should create an empty gameobject
	as a child of the prefab. Unity will recognize the prefab changed, and save. You can then delete the empty you created.
	Unity should now recognize you made changes, and save it.
